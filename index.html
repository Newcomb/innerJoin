    <h1>How Inner Join Works</h1>
    <p>Inner Join allows the user to pull specific data from multiple datasets based
    on a comparison of a certain data value that both datasets hold. After you have selected
  the data you would like to pull and where you would like to pull it from Inner Join allows
you to grab the intersecting rows of the datasets based on the comparison you chose for
your ON parameter. Inner Join then returns the matching data rows and grabs the data you specified
in your SELECT parameter in order to place it in a new table  that now holds the data values you
wanted based on the specific comparisons you made in order to chose the data.
Inner Join is extremely useful because it allows the user to easily grab data from multiple
datasets based on a shared data value instead of having to merge both datasets or sort through
them by hand.</p>
